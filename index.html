        <span class="line-1">00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,130 Now that we've looked at the architecture of the internet, let's see how you might</span>
        <span class="line-2">00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,535 connect your personal devices to the internet inside your house.</span>
        <span class="line-3">00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:11,270 Well there are many ways to connect to the internet, and</span>
        <span class="line-4">00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,960 most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
        <span class="line-5">00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,940 Let's look at an example of how you can connect to the internet.</span>
        <span class="line-6">00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,370 If you live in a city or a town, you probably have a coaxial cable for</span>
        <span class="line-7">00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,880 cable Internet, or a phone line if you have DSL, running to the outside of</span>
        <span class="line-8">00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920 your house, that connects you to the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</span>
        <span class="line-9">00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,730 If you live far out in the country, you'll more likely have</span>
        <span class="line-10">00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,430 a dish outside your house, connecting you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</span>
        <span class="line-11">00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,190 you might also use the telephone system.</span>

        <span class="line-15">00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,780 A modem is what connects the internet to your network at home.</span>
